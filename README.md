## Installation Instructions

### Setting Up Codespaces

We will be using GitHub Codespaces, a cloud-based development environment, for this course. This allows you to code directly in your browser without setting up a local environment.

#### What is GitHub Codespaces?

GitHub Codespaces provides an online development environment powered by Visual Studio Code. It includes a pre-configured environment with all dependencies installed, enabling you to focus on coding.

#### How to Set Up Codespaces for This Course

1. **Fork this Repository**:
   - Go to the [TS-Python-Intermediate-Course](https://github.com/giuseppe-testa/TS-Python-Intermediate-Course).
   - Click on the **Fork** button at the top-right corner to create your copy of the repository.

2. **Create a Codespace**:
   - Navigate to your forked repository.
   - Click the **Code** button and select the **Codespaces** tab.
   - Click **Create Codespace on main**.

3. **Start Coding**:
   - Once the Codespace is ready, it will open in a VS Code-like environment in your browser.
   - Use the terminal within Codespaces to run your Python scripts.

4. **Sync Changes**:
   - All changes you make in Codespaces are saved to your forked repository. You can push changes back to GitHub at any time.


### Installing Python

You will not need Python installed on your machine. But, if you are courious, below are the installation instructions for both Windows and macOS.

#### Windows

1. Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).
2. Download the latest version of Python for Windows.
3. Run the installer and make sure to check the box **Add Python to PATH** before proceeding.
4. Verify the installation by opening the Command Prompt and typing:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   You should see the installed Python version.

#### macOS

1. Open the Terminal and check if Python is pre-installed by typing:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. If not installed, use Homebrew to install Python:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   brew install python
   ```

3. Verify the installation by typing:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
